__Usage__

Open up config.json with any text editor.

Change the email and password to... your email and password.

Change the invoker if you like.

If you have more than one account, the bot supports config arguments.

If your config is named "Account1.json", run the file in your shell, with the argument "Account1.json".

Example: embedbot.py Account1.json

(This also help a lot with testing.)

(Hey, sometimes I'm lazy.)

If you like, you can use a token by replacing bot.run(email, password, bot=False) with bot.run("your token", bot=False).
